# Array4
Problem:  Given an array of integers, write a Python function to move all zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.  Example:  Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12] Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]  Explanation: The non-zero elements are moved to the front of the array, and the zeros are moved to the end.
